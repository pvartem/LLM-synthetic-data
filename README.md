# LLM-synthetic-data
This is a small experimental project exploring how to enhance the quality of solving classical ML tasks using LLM-generated data.

### Brief Overview:
1. **Data Generation for Training**: Utilize LLMs to generate training data.
2. **Data Generation for Testing - Data-Driven Test**: This involves creating a test dataset to evaluate numerous edge, unusual, or common cases.

### Goal:
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
2. Identify weaknesses or challenges.
3. Determine if a somewhat universal algorithm for prompt creation can be developed for most task types.
